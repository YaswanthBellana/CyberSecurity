# Cyber Security Final Year Project

This repository contains the implementation of my final year project on Cyber Security(only 7th semester work, 8th semester work is going on...). The project demonstrates various types of cyber attacks and a steganography technique. Below is an overview of the attacks and techniques included in the project:

---

## üìÇ Folder Structure
1. **Adware Attack** (`Adware/`)
2. **DoS Attack** (`DoS/`)
3. **Malware Attack Using Pendrive** (`Malware_Attack_using_Pendrive/`)
4. **Steganography** (`Steganography/`)

## üî• Attacks Performed

### 1. Adware Attack
- **Description**: This attack displays an intrusive advertisement and captures the viewer's image when they close it.
- **Behavior**:
  - Shows an advertisement.
  - On closing the ad, the attack triggers the device's camera and captures a picture of the person viewing the ad.
- **Goal**: Explores the privacy invasion risks of adware.

### 2. DoS Attack
- **Description**: Denial of Service (DoS) attack to overwhelm and crash a server.
- **Behavior**:
  - Sends multiple simultaneous requests to a targeted server, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Goal**: Illustrates how resource exhaustion can disrupt server functionality.

### 3. Malware Attack Using Pendrive
- **Description**: This attack utilizes a pendrive to execute malicious code.
- **Behavior**:
  - Opens WhatsApp on the victim's system.
  - Sends annoying messages to another user automatically.
- **Goal**: Demonstrates how malware can propagate through removable media and perform automated tasks.

## üñºÔ∏è Steganography
- **Description**: Implementation of steganography for secure communication.
- **Features**:
  - Hides secret messages within images or other media files.
  - Provides a practical demonstration of data hiding techniques.
